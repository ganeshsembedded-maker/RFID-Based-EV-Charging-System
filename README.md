# RFID-Based-EV-Charging-System

RFID-based EV charging system using ATmega328 for secure user authentication and automated charging control.

---

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates an **RFID-based Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging System** using a microcontroller.  
The system allows **authorized users** to charge their EVs securely using **RFID cards/tags**.

The charging process is automated using a relay mechanism, and user authentication is handled through an RFID reader interfaced with an **Arduino UNO (ATmega328)**.
